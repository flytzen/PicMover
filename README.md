# PicMover
Simple little program I wrote to help tidy up my photo archive. I now also use it regularly sort the images from my camera and phone.
Not really intended to share, but feel free to use it if you find it useful.

# Functionality
It basically wraps [MetadataExtractor](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MetadataExtractor/) to get the date a photo or video was made and then moves them into a folder structure I like.
